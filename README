Gi2c 

Gi2c is a basic spd read and write tool written in python3
it depends on smbus2 
you need to enabled the i2c-dev module, and disable any other loaded i2c modules that bind to your spd's eeprom (at24 for example)

modprobe i2c-dev
modprobe -r at24



find some more info about the ddr3 spd here : https://www.h-bomb.nl/ddr3-spd/




arguments : 

--busaddress 
set i2c bus addresss (0 most of the time)



--dimmaddress
set dimm addresss( 0x50 0x51 0x52 0x53 0x54 0x55 )



--writetckmin
set min cycle time tckmin  byte 12 in ns example: --writetckmin 10ns")


--writetckminoffset
 set min cycle time tckmin  offset byte 34 in ns hex (only used on 1933+2133 example: --writetckminoffset -54")   


--writecas
set enabled CAS latencys in bytes 14 and 15 These bytes define which CAS Latency (CL) values are supported. The range is from CL = 4 through CL = 18 with one bit per possible CAS Latency. A 1 in a bit position means that CL is supported, a 0 in that bit position means it is not supported. Since CL = 6 is required for all DDR3 speed bins, bit 2 of SPD byte 14 is always 1.
input is cas latency to enable as list of cl* values
example: python3 MEM.py --writecas cl4 cl5 cl6 cl16


--write
enable global write without this enabled its does a dry-run


--writetofile
write spd to filename

--readfromfile
Read spd from filename
